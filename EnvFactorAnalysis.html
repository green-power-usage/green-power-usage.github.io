			This graph shows the percent of energy that comes from green power for colleges that only have solar power and wind as a green power source vs sunlight hours for the respective college towns. The blue line represents the “curve of best fit” for the data. Intriguingly enough, one would expect colleges in towns with more sunlight hours to be able to rely more on solar power, but two different correlation tests indicated that the relationship was negative, although  wind power as a second source could explain a weaker negative correlation.

    	<center><div id="paragraph"><p>
    		Only Ohio University saw a net increase out of all colleges in ranks 16 through 20. While other colleges began to see declines in green power percentage around the start of the pandemic, Ohio university only flatlined.
