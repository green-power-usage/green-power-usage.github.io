    		The largest jump in rank overtime from the group of the top 5 colleges in July of 2021 was Arizona State University. When ASU was first ranked in the top 30, they were in the teens for a few months before taking a huge leap to be #2 for the past year. Columbia University and University at Buffalo have been in the top 5 since the data has been available. University of California started out in the top 10 before moving into the top 5 after a few months. The top 5 has not had much variability in the past year, but Boston University was brand new to the top 30 in the past few months. Since April 2020, the Top 5 has remained quite consistent with the exception again of Boston University.

    		The colleges ranked 6-10 in July 2021 had much more variability in their rank over the years compared to the current top 5. These colleges had a new rank almost every time the data was released, but most have been in the top 30 since the data has been collected with University of Utah being added to the top 30 in January 2020. University of Maryland had the largest jump in rank from their first appearance in the top 30, starting at 14th and moving to 7th.  They had a slight increase again in rank around April of 2020 but jumped right back down the next time the data was collected. The last three collections they pretty much all maintained their rank, but Stanford and the University of Maryland swapped to be 6th and 7th respectively.

    		These colleges fell in the ranks a bit, except for Northeastern as they only joined the top 30 in the last two measurements and Saint Louis University who stayed pretty much the same as when they first joined the top 30. The Ohio State University took a big tumble in the ranks going from 10th to well into the 20’s but moved its way back down to land at a solid 15th in the last collection. Northwestern also saw an increase in their rank in January of 2020 and were not able to move back down to where they started, which was in the top 6-10 in January of 2018. Saint Louis was able to lower it rank to be at 11th the last time data was collected. It was only one rank better, but they stayed very consistent while the others were all over the place.

    		The number one thing I noticed about these colleges is that over time their rank went down (negative direction), which shows that they were using less green energy as time went on, or other schools began to use more. Ohio University showed a slight improvement in their rank, but it was only a few places, and not a drastic change. They did however have a major jump in their rank to be in the top 25-30, so being able to move back into 20th was a good step on their part. University of North Texas was the one that had the biggest jump in rank. At one point they were in the top 10, but they lost that in January 2020 and then ended up in 17th in July 2021. Once their increase began, it never slowed down.

    		The colleges here were all over the place in terms of their rank over time, and the largest jump was the University of Minnesota in January of 2021. After the University of Minnesota had that large jump to being ranked 16th, it went right back to its higher rank. University of Virginia had a steady incline in their rank, with one slight dip in April of 2020 but the positive slope returned right after. Tarrant County College District was never able to get their rank lower than 19th, and they had a very steady incline between July 2018 and July 2021. Pretty much all these school ended where they started or had an increase of their rank over the few years.

    		There was a lot of movement in rank between these five colleges, with all of them ending with a higher (worse off) rank than they started with. University of Wisconsin had the largest jump by far starting the Green Power partnership in the upper teens and finishing in 29th the last time the data was collected. They truly did not have any sort of decline again, as once they started going up, they were not able to get themselves back down or even to a level point. American University had a time that their rank went down to the lower 20’s, but again that did not last long, and they continued to rise again until they ended up in 30th the last time data was collected. The other three colleges bounced around a bit, but at least ended up closer to where they started or remained somewhat consistent for a few months.
